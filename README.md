# nearmap.com HyperVision C++ Technical Test

## Constraints

* Must be written in C++
* Recommended to build and run on Linux (Ubuntu).
* Recommended to use the Qt SDK (http://qt-project.org/downloads).  Stub project provided.

## Task

* Create a command line tool that can calculate a red, green and blue histogram for an image and write to an output file in the format described below.
  * It should be optimized for performance (e.g. multi-threaded) and should ultilize all processing cores.
   (Please **don't** use third-party libraries such as Intel TBB or OpenMP.)
* Create a unit test to validate the results.  To simplify the build process it is sufficient to include the test case in the command line tool.

## Output format

An ascii text CSV file containing one line for each colour band in the image (in the order red, green, blue).  Each line is a comma separated list of the pixel count for each value (256 per line).

## Submission instructions

* A zip file containing the following - submitted to your agent or nearmap contact.
  * Full source code and project files required to build.  It should compile with no errors or warnings.
  * The output histogram ascii text CSV file for the provided sample image.
  * DO NOT include any build intermediate files in the zip file.
  * DO NOT include the provided sample image in the zip file.


* DO NOT send pull requests against this repository for two reasons:
  * We don't want executables checked into source control
  * We don't want other candidates to see your solution.
